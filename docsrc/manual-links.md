## Radiomaster TX16S Mk2

This is the radio controller used to fly the plane and train in the simulator.
It requires 2x 18650 batteries, which you can install in an included tray, or with an external battery pack they sell.

This controller now ships with EdgeTX firmware, replacing OpenTX on earlier models. The currently posted manuals appear to be out of date
because of this. For that reason, I've added the link to the firmware distribution page.

## Crossfire Nano TX Module

This is the long-range radio transmitter that plugs into the radio controller. It's pretty easy to install, but note that it does not power up
until you create a Model in the radio that uses it.
