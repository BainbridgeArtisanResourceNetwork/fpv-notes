# fpv-notes

Intended to contain notes, tips, component lists, etc. related to DIY FPV building.


### Note about GitHub Pages
I have experimented with publishing this using GitHub Pages, but found that
it greatly increases the complexity - starting with even the themes involved.
So for now, I've left the detritus around using Jekyll to publish it, but 
have disabled the actual publishing.

I'll move the individual files over into '/docsrc' for now, and we can review
the publish process later.
